## Features
> When borrowing credit from a bank,
> there is a division typically responsible for assessing whether a person is eligible for the loan.
> We will investigate the influence of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of defaulting on a loan.

# Introduction: Analyzing Borrower Default Risk <a id='intro'></a>

The project's goal is to prepare a report for the credit division of a bank. We will investigate the impact of a borrower's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of loan default. The bank already has some data on customer creditworthiness.

This report will be considered when making **credit assessments** for potential borrowers. **Credit assessment** is used to evaluate the ability of prospective borrowers to repay their loans.

This analysis aims to determine whether there is a relationship between having children, marital status, income level, and the purpose of the loan on the probability of default.

### Objectives

We will test four hypotheses:

1. The relationship between having children and an individual's loan default rate.
2. Whether there is a relationship between marital status and the probability of loan default.
3. Whether an individual's income level can influence loan default.
4. Whether the purpose of the loan affects the likelihood of loan default.

### Steps

The customer data is stored in two different file paths: `'/datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv'` for the internal file path, and [`'credit_scoring_eng.csv'`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milawidyalestari/data-analyst-ml-project/project2-borrower-default-risk/credit_scoring_eng.csv) for the external file path. The quality of the data is not yet known, so we will first review the dataset. Then, we will perform data preprocessing. After completing these steps, we will test our hypotheses.


This project will be divided into three stages:
1. Data Review
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Hypothesis Testing
